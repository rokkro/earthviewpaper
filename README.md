# Earthviewpaper
Earthviewpaper grabs a random image from [Google's Earthview]( https://earthview.withgoogle.com ) site and sets it as your wallpaper.

#####★ Python 3  must be installed!★

##Linux:
* See your distribution's software repository if Python isn't already installed.
* Earthviewpaper supports Unity 7 and GNOME 3, more desktop environment support to be added later.
* In a terminal: ```python3 /path/to/earthviewpaper.py```

##Windows:
* You'll probably need to [install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).
* Earthviewpaper should work on Windows Vista and newer.
* Double click to run, or in cmd: ```python C:\path\to\earthviewpaper.py```

####Adding to Windows Startup:
* Place a shortcut to the script in your startup folder (enter ```shell:startup``` in Run to access).

#Todo:
1. Figure out how to make this readme look nice.
2. Add more Linux DE support, test stuff.
3. MacOS support.
